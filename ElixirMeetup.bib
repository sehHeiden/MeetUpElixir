	abstract = {We test the efficient market hypothesis to see if Twitter aggregates information faster than a real-money prediction market. We use Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}), a supervised learning algorithm, to predict the outcome of the 2012 U.S. presidential elections via Twitter data. We then compare the prediction from {SVM} against the Iowa Electronic Markets ({IEM}). A total of 40 million unique tweets were collected and analyzed between September 29th 2012 and November 6th 2012. We observe: 1) The {IEM} is efficient on all the above days as per the semi-strong efficient market hypothesis definition [1]. {SVM} does not out predict the {IEM}. 2) The {SVM} prediction results are positively correlated with the {IEM} and predicts Obama winning the election, implying that Twitter can be considered as a valid source in predicting {US} presidential election outcomes. Using the Granger causality test, no causal relationship was inferred between the two-time series. 3) The candidate frequency count distribution independent of any sentiment analysis on all days is also positively correlated with {IEM} and {SVM}. Using Granger causality test, we determined that {IEM} statistically causes the candidate frequency count distribution in Twitter at the 1\% level.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the training of a general-purpose German sentiment classification model. Sentiment classification is an important aspect of general text analytics. Furthermore, it plays a vital role in dialogue systems and voice interfaces that depend on the ability of the system to pick up and understand emotional signals from user utterances. The presented study outlines how we have collected a new German sentiment corpus and then combined this corpus with existing resources to train a broad-coverage German sentiment model. The resulting data set contains 5.4 million labelled samples. We have used the data to train both, a simple convolutional and a transformer-based classification model and compared the results achieved on various training configurations. The model and the data set will be published along with this paper.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the extraction of opinions and information from user-generated text has attracted a lot of interest, largely due to the unprecedented volume of content in Social Media. However, social researchers face some issues in adopting cutting-edge tools for these tasks, as they are usually behind commercial {APIs}, unavailable for other languages than English, or very complex to use for non-experts. To address these issues, we present pysentimiento, a comprehensive multilingual Python toolkit designed for opinion mining and other Social {NLP} tasks. This open-source library brings state-of-the-art models for Spanish, English, Italian, and Portuguese in an easy-to-use Python library, allowing researchers to leverage these techniques. We present a comprehensive assessment of performance for several pre-trained language models across a variety of tasks, languages, and datasets, including an evaluation of fairness in the results.},
